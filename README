FAQ
==========================

How to start the various user-interfaces

    Gtk:
        deluge-gtk
    Console:
        deluge-console
    Web:
        deluge-web
        Go to http://localhost:8112/ default-password = "deluge"

Why is deluge still listed in my system tray even after I close it ?

    You closed the gtk user-interface but you did not close the daemon. Choose "Quit & Shutdown Daemon" to close both Daemon and gtk-ui.

How do I start the daemon?

    deluged

How do I start the daemon with logging to console?

    deluged -d -L <log level>

I can't connect to the daemon from another machine

    * Configure the daemon to allow remote connections
    * Add a user to the auth file located in the config folder: ~/.config/deluge/auth
    * Restart the daemon.

I upgraded from 0.5 and plugin x is missing

    1.0 is a rewrite, all old 0.5 plugins have to be rewritten.
