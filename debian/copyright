 A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
 ==========================

 Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
 Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
 as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
 principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

 In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
 National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
 in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
 software.

 In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
 BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
 year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
 Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
 Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
 non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
 Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
 the PSF.

 All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
 the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
 releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
 the various releases.

 Footnotes:

 (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
     the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

 (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
     CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
     is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

 Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
 direction to make these releases possible.
