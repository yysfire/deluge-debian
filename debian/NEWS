deluge (1.2.0~rc1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  !!! Please read carefully: describing new Debian packages layout.

  This new deluge release comes with a partial rewrite of the core application
  (Twisted) and a complete rewrite of the web user-interface (Ext-Js and AJAX).
  The format of some config/state files changed with this release (Json), so
  please make a _backup_ of your ~/.config/deluge directory before starting the
  application!

  Deluge for Debian has been reworked in order to produce some new binary
  packages and to fix the way they depend each other.
  Now there is a single 'deluge-common' package which all the others depend on.
  You can install the 'deluged' application (probably on a headless machine),
  then use any of the three user-interfaces 'deluge-{console,web,gtk}' to
  connect either to a local or remote running daemon.

  The GTK+ user-interface is actually able to work in Classic Mode by running
  the core application in the same program space (in other words, 'deluge-gtk'
  doesn't depend on 'deluged').

  Each package contains its equally named executable command, with the 'deluge'
  package being the preferred choice for default desktop installations because
  it depends on the GTK+ ui and contains the needed icons and desktop entries.
  Please note that the /usr/bin/deluge executable provided by this package is
  a configurable entry point which will start the default GTK+ user-interface
  and is able to optionally set your default one.

  Upgrade paths from the old 1.x and 0.5.x series have been tested and should
  be working well, but please report any bug you may encounter.

deluge (1.1.3.dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Actually the licensing issue involving the source code implementing the
  torrent creation feature has been solved by upstream.
  This option is finally available through the GTK+ ui.
